# Current State

Im introducing a feature lock, until my current code it up to an acceptable
Standard, that means that every file should be refactored (If required) and
documented(By a Human).

Until this standard is met, no additional features will be added to this
project.

## Documentation

At the current point in time, a lot of my comments where written in
collaboration with github Copilot. I personally believe this to
be an ethical use of AI, As long as Appropriate credit is given. However since
this is a graded assignment, I don't want to give that dumb little robot any
credit for my work.

Going forward I will be using [Doxygen Documentation Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cschlosser.doxdocgen) by Christoph
Schlosser to generate template comment block and then write the content myself.
